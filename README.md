## PyTorch Lightning Training Template

This is a simple, extensible template designed to streamline the creation of PyTorch Lightning-based training pipelines. It provides a foundational structure, allowing you to focus on your model architecture and data processing rather than boilerplate code for training loops, device management, logging, and checkpointing.

> This is a work in progress, will soon use `hydra`
